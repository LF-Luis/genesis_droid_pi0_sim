- Shirt folding: the robot must fold a t-shirt, which starts flattened.
- Bussing easy: the robot must clean a table, putting trash in the trash bin and dishes into the dish bin. The score indicates the number of objects that were placed in the correct receptacle.
- Bussing hard: a harder version of the bussing task, with more objects and more challenging configurations, such as utensils intentionally placed on top of trash objects, objects obstructing each other, and some objects that are not in the pre-training dataset.
- Grocery bagging: the robot must bag all grocery items, such as potato chips, marshmallows, and cat food.
- Toast out of toaster: the robot removes toast from a toaster.
- Fine-tuned eval
    - Franka items in drawer. This task requires opening a drawer, packing items into a drawer, and closing it. Because there is no similar task with the Franka robot in pre-training, we consider this “hard.”
